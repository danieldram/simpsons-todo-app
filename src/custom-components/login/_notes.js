      Hello there, my name is Daniel Ram, I've been a freelance and hired professional web developer for 3+ years and I'm looking to join a great group of other developers to further my technical abilities in the field of web development and technology.

      I'd like to work with your particular team, because I feel the work your team is doing is bringing real value in the world and providing a solution that makes an impact. That is something I strive to be apart of, making real change in the world through use of technology. I also feel that my passion for web development is matched by your team and would both give me the opportunity to contribute to and learn from everyone. I also feel that the technology stack your company is using is very similar to the technology stack I personally use and feel I would be a great fit as a result.

      This application is a small example of my ability and if you feel I would make a great addition to your company, I would love the opportunity to be apart of your company! Thanks for the consideration.

      Daniel Ram
